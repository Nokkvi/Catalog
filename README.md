Ip Address is 34.243.55.29 with SSH port 2200

Application is currently running on:
http://ec2-34-243-55-29.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/

To start the application run ./application.py from command line

Libraries that are needed to run the application are
Flask
Sqlalchemy
oauth2client
requests

All can be downloaded through pip

There is a possiblity of a error when running ./application.py
but running python scri.py should fix that.

client_secrets.json needs to be aquired by creating a new application in GoogleAPIs

fb_client_secrets.json needs to be acuired the same way but on the Facebook developers site
